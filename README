Small test exercise for TeliaTV.

## Requirements
For development, you will only need NodeJS (https://nodejs.org/en/) installed in your environment.
Tested with NodeJS version v12.13.0.

## Setup
- Install Node packages with the following command in project root: `npm install`.
- Start development server with `npm start` command.
- Application can be opened from http://localhost:8080

## Configuration
Configuration is in src/Config.ts file.
OMDB API is used for the application. In Config.ts there is one API key provided already which is limited to 1000 requests per day.
Should you need more requests, then a new key can be generated at http://www.omdbapi.com/apikey.aspx.

Feel free to refactor existing code as you see fit. Good luck!
