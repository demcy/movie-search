## Task 1 (story)
Display detailed information for single movie when search result is clicked.
Currently only IMDB ID is displayed. Movie title and plot should be displayed instead.
TODO:
- Implement new request to OMDB API to get movie title and plot based on IMDB ID.
- Display the title of the movie and plot instead of IMDB ID.

## Task 2 (bug)
When search button is double clicked the duplicate results are displayed.
Expected behaviour is to show only 10 results.

## Task 3 (story)
To optimize application performance multiple similar requests should be avoided.
If user has already searched some keyword then this result can be cached and reused later without new API request.
This cache does not have to survive reload or restart of the application.
TODO:
- Implement cache for Movies search method.

## Task 4 (story)
User can search for movies by release year.
New input field should be added to taskbar and API request improved to accept year.
If user leaves the field empty then year parameter should not be used.
TODO:
- Add new number input field next to keyword text input.
- Use data from that input field and pass it to search API request.

## Task 5 (story)
Search results should be displayed in alphabetical order.
Currently results are in the same order as they come from OMDB API. Instead they should be ordered alphabetically by title.

## Task 6 (story)
Search results are updated without clicking "SEARCH" button. Results should be updated automatically after user
stops typing. There should be about 300ms delay before search results are updated. E.g when single character is entered then
there is 300ms delay. When next character is entered during this period then this delay will be reset. This avoids
unnecessary updates while user is typing. Automatic searching should be done when at least 3 characters have been typed.

## Bonus task
Display number of unique words (case insensitive) in the plot text of the movie.
Display this number after the plot in the detailed information container completed in task 1.
